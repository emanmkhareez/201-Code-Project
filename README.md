***The first lab.***

The first question I asked by the user answers five questions about me: Do they answer yes or no.

***The second lab.***
 I will play a guessing game with them.

This game consists of two stages.

1-The first stage the user tries to find out my favorite number from 0 to 10, and he has 4 attempts
2-The second stage the user tries to find out what is my favorite subject and has six attempts
